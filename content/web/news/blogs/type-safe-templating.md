Kitura has provided support for rendering templated content ever since version 1.0 but now Kitura 2.4 introduces a new type-safe API for rendering Codable structures.

##What is it?

With the release of Kitura 2.4 you can now use Codable structs to render content using templating.

##How do I get started?

Kitura supports multiple template engines:

- Kitura-Stencil
- Kitura-Mustache
- Kitura-Markdown

To use type-safe templating all you need to do is add Kitura (at 2.4 or later) and one of the above template engines to your Package.swift, like so:

```
.package(url: "http://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura", from: "2.4.0"),
.package(url: "http://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-StencilTemplateEngine", from: "1.0.0")
```

##How do I use it?

When you've added Kitura and a template engine to your project you can start rendering your template files with Codable structs. Here is a quick example of that using the popular Stencil templating engine.

All we need to do is create a stencil template file, I called mine `MyStencil.stencil`, and then populate that file with the following:

```
{% if friends %}
    {% for friend in friends %}
        {{friend.firstName}} {{friend.lastName}}
    {% endfor %}
{% else %}
    You have no friends! :(
{% endif %}
```

Next we need to create our Codable struct:

```swift
struct Friend: Codable {
    let firstName: String
    let lastName: String
}
```

Then create an instance of this struct:

```swift
let friends = [Friend(firstName: "Jack", lastName: "Sparrow"), Friend(firstName: "Captain", lastName: "America")]
```

And now we can render the Stencil template file using the friends value:

```swift
router.get("/friends") { request, response, next in
    try response.render("MyStencil.stencil", with: friends, forKey: "friends")
    next()
}
```

The 'forKey' parameter is a new addition to the rendering methods, this allows you to provide the variable name from your template file that this particular struct will populate.

##Next Steps

Because the only requirement is that the struct you want to render is Codable, type-safe templating integrates easily with our Swift-Kuery-ORM. When you call Model.findAll() to retrieve data from your database you can pass the results straight through to your rendering code with type-safety from end to end.
