These led to performance improvements of up to 30% on some benchmarks. A few more obvious bottlenecks do still exist and their solutions are in progress (e.g PR #117). KituraNIO now performs better than KituraNet on the <code class=\"language-text\">plaintext</code> benchmark. Longstanding stress tests were also run to make sure Kitura-NIO is stable over time. We feel that Kitura-NIO is ready for real-world usage and encourage users to try it out.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"announcing-kiturastudio\"><a href=\"#announcing-kiturastudio\" aria-label=\"announcing kiturastudio permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Announcing KituraStudio</h2>\n<p>We are pleased to announce the release of KituraStudio, a new IDE for Server-side Swift from the SCADE team.</p>\n<p>KituraStudio has built-in integration with Docker, allowing you to code, build, and run your Kitura application on Linux in one environment, on macOS.

You now pass callbacks to the API for establishing your connections and preparing statements in the same way as you do currently when executing your queries and transactions.</p>\n<p>Now that Swift-Kuery is entirely asynchronous we are ready for the future of Swift. The new APIs should transition seamlessly to async/await, and it should also be possible to take advantage of the new database drivers being discussed in the Swift Server Working Group.</p>\n<p>Click here for full information and how to migrate to the new version.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"swift-jwt-30\"><a href=\"#swift-jwt-30\" aria-label=\"swift jwt 30 permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Swift-JWT 3.0</h2>\n<p>We have just released version 3.0 of Swift-JWT, our library for creating, signing, and verifying JSON Web Tokens.

However, it’s common for a developer to want to link requests from the same user together in a session. A simple way to achieve this is by using a cookie to identify the user and associating data to that cookie. Kitura-Session allows you to implement this flow and, as of version 3.3, you can now directly store and retrieve Codable objects in users’ sessions.</p>\n<p>Click here for full information on this new feature.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/blogs/announcing-kitura-2-6","title":"Announcing Kitura 2.6 and more!","author":"Ian Partridge","date":"2018-12-18"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
